                    your Order is rejected for any reason. Your Order can be rejected at any time because the Restaurant
                    is too busy, due to weather conditions or for any other reason. If your Order is accepted, payment
                    shall be authorized by CoffeeRun and you shall be provided an estimate on when your Order shall be
                    ready. Neither CoffeeRun nor the Restaurant guarantee that Orders shall be ready for pick-up within

                    resolving your issue. We cannot guarantee that we can resolve any complaint or issue you have
                    because resolution is at the sole discretion of the Restaurant once an Order has been accepted. If
                    we are unable to assist you in resolving a complaint, you shall need to address it directly with the
                    Restaurant. All complaints regarding the quality of any Products should be addressed directly to the
                    Restaurant. CoffeeRun has no obligation to compensate you for any dispute you can have with any
                    Restaurant.</p>
