                    and Conditions</h3>
                <p class="text-dark">Existing customers ("Referrer") who refer friends and family as new customers
                    ("Customer") to the CoffeeRun platform, may be eligible to receive referral credits (“Credit(s)”).
                    Customer must sign up using the unique link ("Link") provided to them by Referrer. The Link must be
                    provided to Customer through email, text, Facebook, Chatty Foodies or Twitter. Referrer is
                    prohibited from posting referral links on sites including, but not limited to Google, Craigslist,
                    Twitter, RetailMeNot and other similar publicly accessible sites. CoffeeRun reserves the right to
                    deactivate or invalidate any Credits obtained through these channels.</p>

                <p class="text-dark">Referrer will only receive Credits for the first 25 Customers they refer. Customer
                    will receive one Credit when they sign up through the Link, are one of the 25 Customers, and meet
                    the requirements as indicated in the offer. CoffeeRun reserves the right to deactivate or invalidate
                    any Credits obtained by either Customer or Referrer in excess of these amounts. Credit amounts vary
                    based on regions, and Referrers location will determine the application region and Credit amount.
                    Credit amounts will be stated in Referrer's CoffeeRun account and in the offer received by Customer.
                    Customer Account requires a minimum subtotal (excluding taxes and fees) on Customer's first order
                    that must be met in order for both Customer and Referrer to receive Credits. Customer will be
                    disqualified and will not receive Credits if CoffeeRun determines that Customer has previously
                    created a CoffeeRun account. CoffeeRun reserves the right to withhold or invalidate Credit obtained
                    through the CoffeeRun Friends and Family Referral Program if CoffeeRun determines or believes that
                    the Credit was received through error, fraudulent, illegal, or in violation of these terms and
                    conditions or any other applicable agreement between you and CoffeeRun.
                </p>

                <p class="text-dark">Credits will be applied automatically at checkout to order amount (excluding
                    gratuity). Credits cannot be applied to alcohol products. Credits can only be redeemed for CoffeeRun
                    orders on theCoffeeRunapp.com or on the CoffeeRun app with the latest version, and within CoffeeRun
                    service areas and delivery hours. Credits cannot be redeemed for cash or cash equivalent. Credits
                    are not transferable and may not be auctioned, traded, bartered, or sold. Credits may not be used in
                    conjunction with select promotions. CoffeeRun reserves the right to withhold or invalidate Credit
                    obtained through the CoffeeRun Friends and Family Referral Program if CoffeeRun determines or
                    believes that the Credit was received through error, fraudulent, illegal, or in violation of these
                    terms and conditions or any other applicable agreement between you and CoffeeRun. CoffeeRun is not a
                    retailer or seller. Subject to change by CoffeeRun at any time. Void where restricted or prohibited
                    by law.</p>
